SUM and COUNT


SELECT SUM(population)
FROM world;

SELECT continent 
FROM world
GROUP BY continent;

SELECT SUM(gdp)
FROM world 
WHERE continent ='Africa';

SELECT COUNT(name) 
FROM world 
WHERE area > 1000000;

SELECT SUM(population) 
FROM world 
WHERE name IN  ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania');

SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world 
GROUP BY continent;

SELECT continent , COUNT(name)
FROM world
WHERE population > 10000000
GROUP BY continent;

SELECT continent
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population) > 100000000;
```

```
Using GROUP BY and HAVING.


SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world 
GROUP BY continent;

SELECT continent ,SUM(population)
FROM world 
GROUP BY continent

SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
WHERE population > 200000000
GROUP BY continent;

SELECT continent, SUM(population)
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population)> 500000000;
```


```
Using SUM, Count, MAX, DISTINCT and ORDER BY


SELECT SUM(population), SUM(gdp)
FROM bbc 
WHERE region ='Europe';

SELECT DISTINCT region FROM bbc;

SELECT name, population 
FROM bbc
WHERE population > 100000000
ORDER BY population DESC;
```

```
The nobel table can be used to practice more SUM and COUNT functions.


SELECT COUNT(winner) FROM nobel;

SELECT DISTINCT subject 
FROM nobel;

SELECT COUNT(subject) FROM nobel
WHERE  subject = 'Physics'
GROUP BY subject ;

SELECT subject, COUNT(*)
FROM nobel
GROUP BY subject;

SELECT subject, MIN(yr)
FROM nobel
GROUP BY subject;

SELECT subject, COUNT(subject)
FROM nobel
WHERE yr = 2000
GROUP BY subject;

SELECT  subject, COUNT(DISTINCT winner) 
FROM nobel 
GROUP BY subject;

SELECT subject, COUNT( DISTINCT yr)
FROM nobel
GROUP BY subject;

SELECT yr
FROM nobel
WHERE subject = 'Physics'
GROUP BY yr
HAVING COUNT(yr) = 3;

SELECT winner 
FROM nobel
GROUP BY winner
HAVING COUNT(winner)> 1;

SELECT winner 
FROM nobel
GROUP BY winner
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT subject)> 1;

SELECT yr, subject
FROM nobel
WHERE yr >= 2000
GROUP BY yr, subject 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT winner) =3 ;
```

The JOIN operation


SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
  WHERE teamid = 'GER';

SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game WHERE id = 1012;

SELECT goal.player,goal.teamid,game.stadium,  game.mdate

SELECT DISTINCT mdate, team1,
